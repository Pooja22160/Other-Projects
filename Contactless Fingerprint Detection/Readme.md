Introduction:

The goal of this project is to capture the biometrics of the right hand for various applications. Developed during the third wave of the pandemic, when lockdowns forced people to stay home and work remotely, this project aims to assist senior citizens and children who were particularly vulnerable due to their weak immunity. With essential tasks like banking and postal services requiring physical presence paused, this project offers a solution by enabling remote biometric capture, allowing necessary work to continue without requiring individuals to be physically present. This innovation not only ensures the safety of vulnerable populations but also maintains the continuity of essential services during unprecedented times. Moreover, it highlights the importance of adapting technology to meet the needs of society in challenging circumstances.
